# HW 5: Numpy Arrays
# Question 4 - Everything is in order

# Given a multidimensional matrix, sort the matrix along the columns.
# >>> np.random.seed(12345)
# >>> a = np.random.randint(1,50,(4,5))
# >>> a
# array([[35, 38, 30, 2, 37],
#        [42, 38, 35, 30, 2],
#        [15, 42, 28, 17, 10],
#        [12, 14, 11, 18, 19]])
# >>> sorting(a)
# array([[12, 14, 11, 2, 2],
#        [15, 38, 28, 17, 10],
#        [35, 38, 30, 18, 19],
#        [42, 42, 35, 30, 37]])
